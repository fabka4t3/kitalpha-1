== Introduction ==

The Viewpoint Manager enables to manage the state of viewpoints used by a project. Once a viewpoint is installed, in conformance to the Viewpoint Lifecycle, four actions are available in the viewpoint manager: reference, unreference, activate, deactivate.

<blockquote>
Note:  
This management, introduced in Kitalpha 1.1.0, differs from the older versions of Kitalpha when the management of viewpoints was at the workspace level and the viewpoint actions were Start and Stop.
</blockquote>


== Management of viewpoint at the project level ==

The state of viewpoint is individually managed by project. To know or change the state of a viewpoint for a project:
* Click on a model element of the project (e.g., on an element of the project browser, on a diagram or diagram element)
* Visualize the viewpoint state in the viewpoint manager


== Open the Viewpoint Manager view ==

* Menu sequence [Window]/[Show View]/[Other…]
* In the "Kitalpha" section of the "Show View" window, select "Viewpoint Manager"
* Click on "OK"


== Reference ==

After installation, the initial state of a viewpoint in the viewpoint manager is ''Unsed'' .
